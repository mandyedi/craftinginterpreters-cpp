# craftinginterpreters-cpp

I decided to delve into the interesting world of interpreters and programming language crafting.
I found a really good tutorial (https://craftinginterpreters.com) that I am going to follow and implement the Lox interpreter step by step in C++.
I should mention the related github project as well: (https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters).
As a future plan I also would like to learn more about modern C++ (17, 20) so I am going to use as much new feature as I can but still keeping the code as simple as possible.
